    <h1> Citizenship </h1>
   <h2></h2>
   <p>More coming soon</p>
   <h3> Honesty, Compassion, Respect, Responsibility and courage are major
   factors in being a good citizen. Honesty is so important because how
   you have to be an honest person in order to be a good citizen and the
   respect is self explanatory as well you can't be disrespectful and be a
   goood citien. Responsibility is important because you have to take car of
   yourself and sometimes others which takes courage which is another aspect.
   Compassion is so important because you need to have some sense of
   understanding for your peers. The aspect of citizenshep I would add is
   is just being law abiding and quite frankly if you have all these traits
   and qualities your a perfect citizen. </h3>
